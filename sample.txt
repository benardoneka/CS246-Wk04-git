“The home is the first and most effective place to learn the lessons of life: truth, honor, virtue, self control, the value of education, honest work, and the purpose and privilege of life. Nothing can take the place of home in rearing and teaching children, and no other success can compensate for failure in the home.”
― President David O. McKay 

“True education does not consist merely in the acquiring of a few facts of science, history, literature, or art, but in the development of character.”
― President David O. McKay
